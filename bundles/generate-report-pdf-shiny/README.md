# Generate Report PDF in Shiny

## About this example

A shiny application that allows users to generate a PDF report based on an RMarkdown document. This app uses a temporary
directory because the app directory may not be writeable.

This code was copied from [shiny-examples](https://github.com/rstudio/shiny-examples/tree/main/112-generate-report).
